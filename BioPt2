Rafaâ€™s musical endeavours range from regularly produced Instagram content to recording and producing dozens of live performances with Half Mad and other local groups. Influenced early on by the likes of modern prog metal and math rock artists, Rafa is active in the contemporary music scene, combining the sounds, colors, and textures of progressive music with modern pop/soul/hip-hop stylings.
